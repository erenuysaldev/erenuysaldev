Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Eren Uysal, a passionate software developer dedicated to continuously improving and expanding my skills in the field of software development.

I have hands-on experience with various technologies, including C#, .NET, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I actively work on both front-end and back-end development, building user-friendly and scalable web applications.

My primary focus is on the C# and .NET ecosystem, where I create dynamic and interactive web applications with ASP.NET MVC. At the same time, I enhance user interfaces with modern web development techniques using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to ensure they are both aesthetic and functional.

I am always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate on projects, and keep up with industry trends to advance my career. ðŸš€
